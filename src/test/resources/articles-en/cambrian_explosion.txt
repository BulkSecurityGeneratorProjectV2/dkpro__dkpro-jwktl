The word {{m|en|Cambrian}} was first used in this context by British [[geologist]] {{w|Adam Sedgwick}} (1785–1873) who named it after [[Cambria]], the [[Latinize]]d form of {{der|en|cy|Cymru||Wales}}, where Britain's Cambrian rocks are best exposed.<ref>{{cite-journal|author=[Adam] Sedgwick|authorlink=Adam Sedgwick|author2=R[oderick] I[mpey] Murchison|authorlink2=Roderick Murchison|title=On the Silurian and Cambrian Systems, Exhibiting the Order in which the Older Sedimentary Strata Succeed each other in England and Wales|journal=Notices of Communications to the [[w:British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]]; at Dublin in August 1835|location=London|publisher=[[w:John  Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], {{w|Albemarle Street}}|year=1835|year_published=1836|pages=59–61|pageurl=https://archive.org/stream/reportannualmee03meetgoog#page/n398/mode/1up/|oclc=31097972}}.</ref> The term and concept was popularized by {{w|Stephen Jay Gould}} in the book {{w|Wonderful Life (book)|Wonderful Life}} (1989).

Was there an external environmental factor that either prevented animals from becoming fossilizable (i.e., large muscular, and/or mineralized) prior to the beginning of the Cambrian, or did some biological or environmental event trigger the metazoan radiation? Hypotheses that have been advanced to explain these questions tend to focus on either an external environmental control on, or an internal property of, the organisms that participated in the '''Cambrian explosion'''.}}

This geologically rapid appearance of diverse multicellular life is referred to as the '''Cambrian explosion''', and is best documented in the fauna of the Burgess Shale (Middle Cambrian-age Stephan Formation) of British Columbia.}}

As well as any rocks known anywhere, they document the remarkable diversification of animal life popularly known as the '''Cambrian Explosion'''. In the broadest possible sense, the Kotuikan cliffs record the beginnings of the modern world, a world in which animals swim, crawl, or walk beneath an atmosphere of breathable air. That's really what brought us here.}}

A full adder circuit might appear after say 32,000 steps; and 2-, 3-, and 4-bit adders fairly quickly after that. In other words, we found periods of quiescence, followed by miniature "'''Cambrian explosions'''" of rapid evolution.}}
